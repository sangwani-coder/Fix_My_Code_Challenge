# Fix-my-code-0
In this project I will be fixing code without recoding everything.

## Tasks
* **0. FizzBuzz**
[0-fizzbuzzz.py](./0-fizzbuzz.py): Code written in python that implements the FizzBuzz challenge.
* Requirement: The code should print `FizzBuzz` When a number is both a multiple of 3 and 5 not `fizz`
## Original code
[0-fizzbuzz.py](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/master/0-fizzbuzz.py)
## My fixed code:
[0-fizzbuzz.py](./0-fizzbuzz.py)
### Runnning the code
$ ./0-fizzbuzz.py 89
## Solution
I swapped the order of the `if/elif` statements. Started by checking if `number` was a multiple of `3` and `5`.
